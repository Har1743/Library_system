# Library System

## What is Library

A library is a place where we can have access to a variety of resources with the help of books. We can also read or issue the books from library.

## Issues related to Library

As Library consists of a large number of books so for that we also have to manage the data, but manually its quite impossible.

**I have made a Library System program which helps to overcome this issue**

## What is Library System

Library System is an organised **Command Line** and **Python based** program which helps in managing of data related to students data and books.  
It is also **User friendly**.  
It stores all the data in a mysql database and you can just choose or enter your choice what you want to perform it will help you to perform that action in a very systematic way.
  
It can help you in managing many ways :-  
  
* Add a new entry of student
* Issuing of book
* Return book
* Re-issuing of book
* Can show any student database.
* Delete any student entry.

## Modules used

**mysql.connector**

## How it works

git clone https://github.com/Har1743/Library_system.git

**Then first you have to setup a table in your own choice database and for that just run**  
  
`python3 database_former.py`  
  
**After this you can use the library system using**
  
`python3 library_system.py`
